# Solana MagicBlock

Experimentation using [MagicBlock](https://www.magicblock.xyz/) to solve usability problems<br/>

MagicBlock is a Solana _network extension_ for building a new type of consumer applications that are open, decentralized and unstoppable. MagicBlock accelerates and extends Solanaâ€™s capabilities while preserving composability.

MagicBlock introduces a new primitive to accelerate and scale Solana without state fragmentation. **Ephemeral Rollups** are Just-In-Time, SVM-based runtimes that accelerate state transitions for selected Solana Accounts. Developers can delegate any account from existing Solana smart contracts into the MagicBlock Engine to access faster performances, customizable runtimes and/or dedicated blockspace.
